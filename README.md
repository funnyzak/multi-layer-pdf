## Features

Some features in this template project:

- Use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
- Use tox、pytest、pytest-cov、coverage for testing.
- Use black、isort for code formatting.
- Use flake8 link for code linting.
- Use mypy for static type checking.
- Use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for code quality.
- Use ipdb3 for debugging.
- Multiple python versions support(Python 3.8.1+).
- More features to be added 🚀 .

## Project

Contains the following projects under `src` as demo:

- [hello](https://github.com/funnyzak/pyproject-starter/tree/main/src/hello) is a simple hello world project.
- [pdf_parse](https://github.com/funnyzak/pyproject-starter/tree/main/src/pdf_parse) is a project that parse pdf.

## Prerequisite

Run project need the following environment installed:

- [Python 3.8.1+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Poetry 1.3.2](https://python-poetry.org/)

If you want development, you need to install  [pre-commit V3](https://pre-commit.com/) for git hook scripts.

## Installation

following the steps below to setup the project:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:funnyzak/pyproject-starter.git && cd pyproject-starter

# Install all dependencies
poetry install --sync --all-extras --with dev,test,coverage

# install git hook scripts for development
pre-commit install

# Other useful installation dependencies commands
# Install dependencies with all extras
poetry install --all-extras
# Install dependencies with extras 'pdf' for pdf_parse project
poetry install --extras "pdf"
# Install dependencies with group 'dev'、'test' for development
poetry install --with dev,test
# Only install required dependencies for production
poetry install

# Specify python version
poetry env use python3.9
```

## Usage

There are some useful commands for development:

```bash
# Run project => hello
poetry run hello

# Run project => pdf_parse: merge pdf
poetry run merge_pdf_demo

# Run project => pdf_parse: parse multi pdf to multi-layer pdf
poetry run multi_layer_pdf_demo

# Extract text to json from pdf
poetry run extract_text_from_pdf

# Debug "hello" project with ipdb3
poetry run ipdb3 ./src/hello/main.py

# Code test
poetry run pytest -s

# Run default coverage test
poetry run tox

# Run hello project coverage test at python 3.9 and 3.10
poetry run tox -e py{39,310}-hello

# Lint with black
poetry run black ./src --check

# Format code with black
poetry run black ./src

# Check with mypy
poetry run mypy ./src

# Check import order with isort
poetry run isort ./src --check

# Lint with flake8
poetry run flake8 ./src
```

## Q&A

### Development

#### Add new project

1. Create a new folder under `src` folder.
2. You can copy the `hello` project as a template.
3. Add folder name to `packages` in `pyproject.toml` file.
4. Code and test it.

#### Tip for project

- You can create test cases for the new project in `tests` folder.
- You can define script commands for the new project in `pyproject.toml` file. like `poetry run hello` command.
- You can add new project to `tox.ini` file for coverage test.
- You can add new project to `mypy.ini` file for static type checking.

### Environment setup

#### install poetry

See [poetry installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

#### install python3

See [python installation](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

#### install pre-commit

See [pre-commit installation](https://pre-commit.com/#install).
