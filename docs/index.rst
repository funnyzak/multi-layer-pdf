A template for the python project. It uses
`poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`__ for dependency management and
`tox <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox>`__ for testing.



Features
--------

Some features in this template project:

-  Use `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`__ for dependency
   management.
-  Use tox„ÄÅpytest„ÄÅpytest-cov„ÄÅcoverage for testing.
-  Use black„ÄÅisort for code formatting.
-  Use flake8 link for code linting.
-  Use mypy for static type checking.
-  Use `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`__ for code quality.
-  Use ipdb3 for debugging.
-  Multiple python versions support(Python 3.7+).
-  More features to be added üöÄ .

Project
-------

Contains the following projects under ``src`` as demo:

-  `hello <https://github.com/funnyzak/pyproject-starter/tree/main/src/hello>`__
   is a simple hello world project.
-  `pdf_parse <https://github.com/funnyzak/pyproject-starter/tree/main/src/pdf_parse>`__
   is a project that parse pdf.

Prerequisite
------------

-  `Python 3.7+ <https://www.python.org/>`__
-  `Poetry 1.2 <https://python-poetry.org/>`__
-  `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`__

Installation
------------

following the steps below to setup the project:

..  code-block:: php

   # Clone the repository
   git clone git@github.com:funnyzak/pyproject-starter.git && cd pyproject-starter

   # Install all dependencies
   poetry install --sync --all-extras --with dev,test,coverage

   # install git hook scripts for development
   pre-commit install

   # Other useful installation dependencies commands
   # Install dependencies with all extras
   poetry install --all-extras
   # Install dependencies with extras 'pdf' for pdf_parse project
   poetry install --extras "pdf"
   # Install dependencies with group 'dev'„ÄÅ'test' for development
   poetry install --with dev,test
   # Only install required dependencies for production
   poetry install


Usage
-----

There are some useful commands for development:

..  code-block:: bash

   # Run project => hello
   poetry run hello

   # Run project => pdf_parse: merge pdf
   poetry run merge_pdf_demo

   # Run project => pdf_parse: parse multi pdf to multi-layer pdf
   poetry run multi_layer_pdf_demo

   # Debug "hello" project with ipdb3
   poetry run ipdb3 ./src/hello/main.py

   # Code test
   poetry run pytest -s

   # Run default coverage test
   poetry run tox

   # Run hello project coverage test at python 3.9 and 3.10
   poetry run tox -e py{39,310}-hello

   # Lint with black
   poetry run black ./src --check

   # Format code with black
   poetry run black ./src

   # Check with mypy
   poetry run mypy ./src

   # Check import order with isort
   poetry run isort ./src --check

   # Lint with flake8
   poetry run flake8 ./src

Q&A

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~

Add new project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Create a new folder under ``src`` folder.
2. You can copy the ``hello`` project as a template.
3. Add folder name to ``packages`` in ``pyproject.toml`` file.
4. Code and test it.

Tip for project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  You can create test cases for the new project in ``tests`` folder.
-  You can define script commands for the new project in
   ``pyproject.toml`` file. like ``poetry run hello`` command.
-  You can add new project to ``tox.ini`` file for coverage test.
-  You can add new project to ``mypy.ini`` file for static type
   checking.

Environment setup
